[1] In the event of the voluntary joinder of parties or joinder of actions, the values of the claims are added together insofar as they are not mutually exclusive.

[2] In case of permissive joinder of parties, the type of procedure for each claim is maintained despite the addition of their values.

[**Art. 94** Counterclaim](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2010/262/en#art_94) 

[1] In the case of an action and counterclaim, the value in dispute is determined by the action with the higher value.

[2] If no party entirely is successful, the costs are allocated in accordance with the outcome of the case.

[3] If three or more persons are participating in the proceedings as principal parties or accessory parties, the court shall determine each party's share of the costs. It may hold the parties jointly and severally liable.

[**Art. 107** Discretionary allocation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2010/262/en#art_107) 

[1] The court may diverge from the general principles of allocation and allocate the costs at its own discretion:

|    [1bis] In the event of the dismissal of actions under company law for performance to the company, the court may at its discretion apportion the procedural costs between the company and the plaintiff. 

[2] Court costs that are not attributable to any party or third party may be charged to the canton if equitable.

[2] The party liable to pay shall reimburse the other party his or her advances and shall pay the other party the party costs awarded.

[3] The provisions on legal aid are reserved.

|    a. in matters of bankruptcy and composition;  
|    b. in non-contentious matters.

[**Art. 256** Decision](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2010/262/en#art_256) 

[1] The court may dispense with a hearing and decide on the basis of the case files, unless the law provides otherwise.

[2] If an order in a non-contentious matter retrospectively proves incorrect, it may be cancelled or modified *ex officio* or on request, provided this does not conflict with the law or the principle of legal certainty.

[1] Any person who is not prepared to recognise the injunction may file an opposition with the court within 30 days of notice thereof being given by publication and at the property. The opposition needs no statement of grounds.

[1] The court shall order the interim measures required provided the applicant shows credibly that:


|    a. a right to which he or she is entitled has been violated or a violation is anticipated; and  
|    b. the violation threatens to cause not easily reparable harm to the applicant.

[2] The court may refrain from ordering interim measures if the opposing party provides appropriate security.

[**Art. 262** Subject matter](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2010/262/en#art_262) 

The court may order any interim measure suitable to prevent the imminent harm, in particular:

[**Art. 264** Security and damages](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2010/262/en#art_264) 

[1] The court may make the interim measure conditional on the payment of security by the applicant if it is anticipated that the measures may cause loss or damage to the opposing party.

[2] The applicant is liable for any loss or damage caused by unjustified interim measures. If the applicant proves, however, that he or she applied for the measures in good faith, the court may reduce the damages or entirely release the applicant from liability.

[3] The security must be released once it is established that no action for damages will be filed; in case of uncertainty, the court shall set a deadline for filing the action.

[**Art. 265** *Ex-parte* interim measures](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2010/262/en#art_265) 

[1] In cases of special urgency, and in particular where there is a risk that the enforcement of the measure will be frustrated, the court may order the interim measure immediately and without hearing the opposing party.

[2] At the same time, the court shall summon the parties to a hearing, which must take place immediately, or set a deadline for the opposing party to comment in writing. Having heard the opposing party, the court shall decide on the application immediately.

[3] Before ordering interim measures, the court may *ex officio* order the applicant to provide security.

|    b. the violation is obviously not justified; and  
|    c. the measure does not seem disproportionate.

[**Art. 267** Enforcement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2010/262/en#art_267) 

The court that orders the interim measure shall also take the required enforcement measures.

[1] The interim measures may be modified or revoked if the circumstances have changed or if the measures have proven unjustified.

[2] The measures become automatically ineffective when the decision on the merits comes into force. The court may order their continuation if it serves the enforcement of the decision or if the law so provides.

[**Art. 269** Reservation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2010/262/en#art_269)

[2] The opposing party shall be served with the protective letter only if he or she initiates the relevant proceedings.

[3] The arbitral tribunal or the ordinary court may make the interim measures conditional on the payment of security if it is anticipated that the measures may cause harm to the other party.

[4] The applicant is liable for the harm caused by unjustified interim measures. If he or she proves, however, that the application for the measures was made in good faith, the arbitral tribunal or the ordinary court may reduce the damages or relieve the applicant entirely from liability.

|    b. the asserted claims are identical or factually connected.

[2] Factually connected claims between the same parties may be joined in the same arbitration proceedings if they are the subject of corresponding arbitration agreements between these parties.

[3] The intervention of a third party and the joinder of a person notified as a party to an action require an arbitration agreement between the third party and the parties to the dispute and are subject to the consent of the arbitral tribunal.

[**Art. 377** Set-off and counterclaim](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2010/262/en#art_377) 

[1] The arbitral tribunal has jurisdiction to decide the set-off defence, even if the claim to be set off does not fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement or is subject to another arbitration agreement or an agreement on jurisdiction.
