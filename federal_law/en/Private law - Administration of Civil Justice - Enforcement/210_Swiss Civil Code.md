###### [II. Action for annulment](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_3/chap_4/lvl_C/lvl_I_I)

[**Art. 108**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_108) 

[1] An action for annulment must be brought within six months of learning of the grounds for annulment or of the date on which the threat ceased, but in any event within five years of the wedding.

[2] The right to bring an action for annulment does not pass to heirs; however, an heir may continue an action already brought.

##### [D. Effects of judgment](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_3/chap_4/lvl_D)

[**Art. 109**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_109) 

[1] A marriage does not become invalid until a court has declared it annulled; prior to such judgment it has all the effects of a valid marriage with the exception of claims under inheritance law, which in any event the surviving spouse loses.

[2] The provisions governing divorce apply *mutatis mutandis* to the effects of a court declaration of annulment on the spouses and their children.

[3] The presumption of paternity in favour of the husband does not apply if the marriage is annulled because it served to circumvent the provisions on the admission and residence of foreign nationals.

[1] A spouse who has changed his or her surname on marriage retains that surname following divorce; he or she may at any time declare before the civil registrar the wish to revert to the name by which he or she was known prior to the marriage.

##### [B. Marital property law and inheritance law](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_B)

[**Art. 120**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_120)

[2] Divorced spouses have no rights of inheritance in relation to each other and may not make claims based on testamentary dispositions made before their divorce proceedings were made pending.

##### [C. Family home](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_C)

[**Art. 121**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_121) 

[1] If a spouse must remain in the family home because of the children or for other compelling reasons, the court may transfer the rights and obligations under the tenancy agreement to that spouse provided this is not inequitable for the other.

[2] The previous tenant is jointly and severally liable for payment of the rent up to the date on which the tenancy ends or may be terminated pursuant to the tenancy agreement or by law, but for a maximum period of two years; if an action is brought to recover rent due, he or she is entitled to set off the amount paid in instalments equal to the amount of the monthly rent against any maintenance payments owed to the other spouse.

[3] If the home belongs to the family of one of the spouses, the court may, on the same conditions, grant the other spouse a right of residence for a fixed term in return for reasonable compensation or set-off against maintenance payments. Where new and compelling reasons so require, such right of residence may be restricted or revoked.

##### [D. Occupational pensions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_D)

###### [I. Principle](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_D/lvl_I)

[**Art. 122**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_122)

In the event of divorce, any occupational pension assets accrued during the marriage up to the point at which divorce proceedings commence are divided equitably. 

###### [II. Equitable division of termination benefits](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_D/lvl_I_I)

[**Art. 123**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_123)

[1] Termination benefits including vested benefits and early withdrawals for purchasing owner-occupied property are divided equally.

[2] Paragraph 1 does not apply to one-off contributions from individual property in accordance with the law.

[3] The termination benefits to be divided are calculated on the basis of Articles 15–17 and 22*a* or 22*b* of the Vested Benefits Act of 17 December 1993.

###### [III. Equitable division of invalidity pension prior to statutory retirement age](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_D/lvl_II_I)

[**Art. 124**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_124)

[1] If, at the point at which divorce proceedings commence, a spouse is drawing an invalidity pension prior to the statutory retirement age, the amount to which he or she would be entitled under Article 2 paragraph 1[ter] of the Vested Benefits Act of 17 December 1993 following cancellation of the invalidity pension counts as the termination benefits.

[2] The provisions on the equitable division of termination benefits apply *mutatis mutandis*.

[3] The Federal Council determines in which cases the amount under paragraph 1 may not be applied in the division because there has been a reduction due to over-compensation.

###### [IV. Equitable division in the case of invalidity pensions after statutory retirement age and in the case of retirement pensions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_D/lvl_I_V)

[**Art. 124***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_124_a)

[1] If, at the point at which divorce proceedings commence, a spouse is drawing an invalidity pension after the statutory retirement age or drawing a retirement pension, the court decides at its own discretion how the pension is to be divided. In doing so it primarily takes into account the duration of the marriage and the pension requirements of each spouse.

[2] The share of the pension awarded to the spouse entitled thereto is converted into a life-long pension. This is paid to the entitled spouse by the liable spouse’s occupational pension fund or is transferred to the entitled spouse’s own occupational pension fund.

[3] The Federal Council regulates:


|    1. the actuarial conversion of the share of the pension into a life-long pension;  
|    2. the procedure in cases in which the retirement benefits are postponed or the invalidity pension is reduced due to over-compensation.

###### [V. Exceptions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_D/lvl_V)

[**Art. 124***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_124_b)

[1] The spouses may, in an agreement on the consequences of the divorce, agree not to divide the assets equally or not to divide them at all if there are sufficient retirement pension and invalidity pension funds otherwise.

[2] The court may award the entitled spouse less than half of the termination benefits or rule that they should not be divided if good cause exists. Good cause exists above all when equal division would be unreasonable:


|    1. in view of the division of marital property or the economic circumstances following divorce;  
|    2. in view of the pension requirements, in particular with regard to the difference in age between the spouses. 

[3] The court may award the entitled spouse more than half of the termination benefits if he or she cares for joint children following the divorce and the liable spouse continues to have sufficient retirement and invalidity pension assets.

###### [VI. Offset of mutual entitlements](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_D/lvl_V_I)

[**Art. 124***c*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_124_c)

[1] The spouses’ mutual entitlements to termination benefits or a share of a pension are offset. The pension entitlement is offset before the share of the pension awarded to the entitled spouse is converted into a life-long pension.

[2] Termination benefits may only be offset against a share of a pension if the spouses and the occupational pension institutions agree.

###### [VII. Unreasonableness](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_D/lvl_VI_I)

[**Art. 124***d*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_124_d)

If, having considered the pension requirements of both spouses, an equitable division of occupational pension assets is unreasonable, the liable spouse shall owe the entitled spouse a lump sum payment.

###### [VIII. Impossibility](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_D/lvl_VII_I)

[**Art. 124***e*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_124_e)

[1] If the equitable division of pension fund assets is not possible, the liable spouse shall owe the entitled spouse adequate compensation in the form of a lump sum payment or as a pension.

[2] A Swiss judgment may be amended at the request of the liable spouse if pension entitlements existing abroad have been offset by adequate compensation pursuant to paragraph 1 and such pension entitlements are then divided up in a foreign decision that is binding on the foreign party liable to pay pension contributions.

##### [E. Post-marital maintenance](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_E)

###### [I. Requirements](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_E/lvl_I)

[**Art. 125**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_125) 

[1] If a spouse cannot reasonably be expected to provide for his or her own maintenance, including an appropriate level of retirement provision, the other spouse must pay a suitable contribution.

[2] In deciding whether such a contribution is to be made and, if so, in what amount and for how long, the following factors in particular must be considered:


|    1. the division of duties during the marriage;  
|    2. the duration of the marriage;  
|    3. the standard of living during the marriage;  
|    4. the age and health of the spouses;  
|    5. the income and assets of the spouses;  
|    6. the extent and duration of child care still required of the spouses;  
|    7. the vocational training and career prospects of the spouses and the likely cost of reintegration into working life;  
|    8. expectancy of federal old age and survivor’s insurance benefits and of occupational or other private or state pensions, including the expected proceeds of any division of withdrawal benefits.

[3] Exceptionally, a maintenance contribution may be denied or reduced if it would clearly be inequitable, particularly because the spouse otherwise entitled to receive such contribution:


|    1. has grossly neglected his or her duty to contribute to the maintenance of the family;  
|    2. has wilfully brought about his or her own indigence;  
|    3. has committed a serious criminal offence against the other spouse or a person close to him or her.

###### [II. Modalities of maintenance contributions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_E/lvl_I_I)

[**Art. 126**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_126) 

[1] The court shall fix an amount to be paid periodically by way of maintenance contribution and set the date on which the duty of maintenance commences.

[2] Where justified in specific circumstances, a lump sum settlement may be ordered instead of regular payments.

[3] The court may attach conditions to the maintenance contribution.

###### [III. Regular payments](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_E/lvl_II_I)

[**Art. 127**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_127) 

The spouses may wholly or in part exclude any alteration of the regular maintenance payments stipulated in the agreement.

###### [2. Adjustment for inflation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_E/lvl_II_I/lvl_2)

[**Art. 128**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_128) 

The court may direct that the maintenance contribution will automatically increase or decrease depending on specified changes in the cost of living.

###### [3. Adjustment by court order](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_E/lvl_II_I/lvl_3)

[**Art. 129**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_129) 

[1] In the event of a substantial and enduring change in circumstances, the periodic maintenance payments may be reduced, cancelled or suspended for a certain time; an improvement in the circumstances of the party entitled to maintenance may be taken into account only if the payments stipulated in the divorce decree provided sufficient maintenance.

[2] The party entitled to maintenance may request that the payments be adjusted in line with future inflation if the income of the other party has increased unexpectedly since the divorce.

[3] Within five years of the divorce, the party entitled to maintenance may request that payments be ordered or increased provided the divorce decree states that it was not possible at that time to order sufficient maintenance payments and provided the economic circumstances of the party obliged to pay maintenance have since improved.

###### [4. Expiry by law](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_E/lvl_II_I/lvl_4)

[**Art. 130**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_130) 

[1] The duty to pay maintenance expires on the death of either the receiving party or the paying party.

[2] Unless otherwise agreed, it likewise expires on the remarriage of the party entitled to receive maintenance.

###### [IV. Enforcement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_E/lvl_I_V)

[2] The Federal Council determines the terms of enforcement assistance.

###### [2. Advance payments](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_E/lvl_I_V/lvl_2)

[**Art. 131***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_131_a)

[1] Public law may provide for advance payments to be made should the liable person fail to make the necessary maintenance payments.

[2] If the state authority makes maintenance payments to the entitled person, the maintenance entitlement with all rights is assigned to the state authority.

[**Art. 132**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_132) 

[1] If the party obliged to pay maintenance fails to do so, the court may order his debtors to make payment in whole or in part to the party entitled to maintenance.

[2] If the party obliged to pay maintenance persistently fails to do so, or if there are grounds to suspect that said party is preparing to abscond or is dissipating or concealing his assets, the court may order him to post appropriate security for future maintenance contributions.

##### [F. Children](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_F)

###### [I. Parental rights and obligations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_F/lvl_I)

[**Art. 133**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_133)

[1] The court regulates parental rights and obligations in accordance with the provisions on the legal effects of the parent-child relationship. In particular it regulates:


|    1. parental responsibility;  
|    2. residence;  
|    3. contact (Art. 273) or the sharing of parenting duties; and  
|    4. child maintenance contributions.

[2] It shall consider all circumstances important to the child's best interests. It shall take account of a joint proposal by the parents and, if feasible, the opinion of the child.

[2] The requirements for the modification of other parental rights and -obligations are governed by the provisions on the effects of the parent-child relationship.

[3] If the parents agree, the child protection authority reassesses parental responsibility, residence and approves a child support agreement. In the other cases, the court competent to modify the divorce decree decides.

[4] If the court is required to decide on the modification of parental responsibility, residence or the child maintenance contribution for a minor child, it shall if necessary also reassess contact or sharing of parenting duties; in the other cases, the child protection authority shall decide on the modification of contact or sharing of parenting duties.

[1] Where a child was born within 300 days of the dissolution of the marriage as a result of death and the mother has since remarried, the second husband is deemed to be the father.

[2] If this presumption is disproved, the first husband is deemed to be the father.

|    2. by the child or, after his or her death, by his or her issue if the spouses ceased living together while the child was still a minor or if recognition did not occur until after the child's twelfth birthday;  
|    3. by the husband’s commune of origin or residence;  
|    4. by the husband.

[3] The provisions governing challenge of recognition apply *mutatis mutandis*.

[1] Recognition may be challenged before the courts by any interested party, namely the mother, the child or, after its death, its issue, and by the commune of origin or domicile of the recognising person.

[2] The recognising person is entitled to file a challenge only if he or she recognised the child under threat of imminent and substantial risk to his or her own life, limb, reputation or property or to those of a person close to him or her, or in the erroneous belief that he was the father.

[2] Where contact with the child is not in its best interests, or the parents breach their duties in the course of such contact or have not cared for the child to any meaningful degree, or other good cause exists, the parents’ right of contact with the child may be refused or withdrawn.

[3] Where the parents have consented to the adoption of their child or their consent may be dispensed with, their right of contact with the child is extinguished as soon as the child is placed in foster care with a view to future adoption.

###### [II. Third parties](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_2/tit_8/chap_1/lvl_D/lvl_I_I)

[1] Responsibility for orders regulating rights of contact with the child lies with the child protection authority at the child’s domicile and with that of his or her place of temporary residence, insofar as the latter has taken or is taking child protection measures.

[2] If the court regulates parental responsibility, residence or the child maintenance contribution in accordance with the provisions on the divorce and protection of the marital union, it shall also regulate contact.

[3] Where no orders have yet been issued regulating the father’s and mother’s contact entitlements, no contact may be had against the will of the person granted parental responsibility or with whom the child resides.

[1] The duty of maintenance towards a minor shall take precedence over other maintenance duties under family law. 

[2] In justified cases, the court may disregard this rule, in particular in order to prevent any disadvantage to a child entitled to maintenance who is of age.

##### [B. Duration](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_2/tit_8/chap_2/lvl_B)

[**Art. 285**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_285)

[1] The child maintenance contribution should correspond to the child’s needs and to the parents’ financial circumstances and resources; the child’s assets and income must be taken into account.

[2] The child maintenance contribution also serves to ensure that the child is cared for by the parents or by third parties.

[3] The child maintenance contribution is payable in advance on the dates stipulated by the court.

###### [2. Other payments for maintenance of the child](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_2/tit_8/chap_2/lvl_D/lvl_I_V/lvl_2)

[**Art. 285***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_285_a)

[1] Family allowance credits paid to the parent required to pay maintenance must be paid in addition to the maintenance. 

[2] Unless the court rules otherwise, any child allowance, social security children’s supplement and similar child support benefits to which the parent subject to the duty of maintenance is entitled must be paid in addition to the child maintenance contribution.

[3] Where as a result of old age or invalidity the parent subject to the duty of maintenance subsequently receives social security, children’s supplements or similar child support benefits which replace his or her employment income, he or she must pay said benefits to the child; by operation of law, his or her existing child maintenance contribution is automatically reduced by the amount of such new benefits.

###### [V. Change of circumstances](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_2/tit_8/chap_2/lvl_D/lvl_V)

[2] If circumstances change considerably, at the request of one parent or the child the court will set a new level of child maintenance contribution or revoke it entirely.

[3] Should the child have unforeseen, extraordinary needs the court may order the parents to make a special financial contribution.

###### [2. Shortfalls](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_2/tit_8/chap_2/lvl_D/lvl_V/lvl_2)

[**Art. 286***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_286_a)

[1] If it was previously established in an approved maintenance agreement or a decision that no maintenance contribution could be set to provide due maintenance for the child, and should the circumstances of the parent liable to pay maintenance have since improved substantially, the child is entitled to claim payments that were not met by this parent during the previous five years in which payments were owed to provide due maintenance.

[2] This claim must be brought within one year of it being known that the circumstances have improved substantially. 

[3] This claim passes with all rights to the other parent or to the state authority in as far as this parent or the state authority has met the missing share of the due maintenance.

[3] If the agreement is concluded in court proceedings, such approval must be given by the court.

###### [II. Scope of a maintenance agreement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_2/tit_8/chap_2/lvl_E/lvl_I_I)

[**Art. 287***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_287_a)

|    the amount required to cover any shortfall in the due maintenance of each child;   
|    if and to what extent the maintenance contributions will be adjusted to reflect changes in living costs. 

###### [III. Final settlement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_2/tit_8/chap_2/lvl_E/lvl_II_I)

[**Art. 288**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_288)

[1] Full and final settlement of the child’s maintenance entitlement may be agreed if it is in the child’s best interests.

[**Art. 289**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_289)

[1] The right to child maintenance contributions is that of the child and, so long as he or she is a minor, is fulfilled by payment to the child's legal representative or to the person with whom the child resides, unless the court decides otherwise.

[2] However, where the state authority assumes the cost of maintaining the child, such claim and all attendant rights pass to the state authority.

###### [II. Enforcement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_2/tit_8/chap_2/lvl_F/lvl_I_I)

###### [2. Directions to debtors](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_2/tit_8/chap_2/lvl_F/lvl_I_I/lvl_2)

[**Art. 291**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_291)

[1] Foster parents are entitled to receive an appropriate fostering allowance unless otherwise agreed or clearly dictated by the circumstances.

[2] Where children are fostered by close relatives or with a view to subsequent adoption there is a presumption that no remuneration is due.

##### [J. Rights of the unmarried mother](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_2/tit_8/chap_2/lvl_J)

[2] On grounds of equity, the court may award partial or full compensation for such costs if the pregnancy ends prematurely.

[3] Third-party payments to which the mother is entitled by law or by contract must be taken into consideration to the extent justified in the circumstances.

##### [A. Principles](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_2/tit_8/chap_3/lvl_A)

[**Art. 296**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_296)

[1] Parental responsibility serves the best interests of the child.

[2] Until such time as they attain the age of majority, children remain the joint parental responsibility of their father and mother.

[3] Parents who are minors or subject to a general deputyship may not exercise parental responsibility. When the parents attain the age of majority, they are assigned parental responsibility. If the general deputyship is revoked, the child protection authority shall assign parental responsibility in a manner appropriate to the child's best interests.

##### [A[bis]. Death of a parent](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_2/tit_8/chap_3/lvl_A_bis)

[**Art. 297**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_297)

[1] If the parents have joint parental responsibility and one parent dies, the surviving parent retains sole parental responsibility.

[2] If a parent who has sole parental responsibility dies, the child protection authority shall assign parental responsibility to the surviving parent or if a legal guardian is appointed for the child, to the person more suited to safeguarding the child's best interests.

##### [A[ter]. Divorce and other marital proceedings](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_2/tit_8/chap_3/lvl_A_ter)

[**Art. 298**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_298)

[1] In divorce proceedings or proceedings to protect the marital union, the court shall assign one parent sole parental responsibility if this is necessary to safeguard the child's best interests.

[2] It may limit itself to regulating residence, contact or sharing of parenting duties if there is no prospect of the parents agreeing on these matters.

[2bis] When regulating residence, contact and the sharing of parenting duties it shall take account of the right of the child to maintain regular personal relationships with both parents.

[2ter] Where joint parental responsibility is awarded, with respect to the child’s best interests, it shall consider the possibility of the child residing with both parents on an alternating basis, if this is requested by one of the parents or by the child.

[3] It shall request the child protection authority to appoint a legal guardian for the child if neither the mother nor the father can be expected to accept parental responsibility.

##### [A[quater]. Recognition and court declaration of paternity](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_2/tit_8/chap_3/lvl_A_quater)

[**Art. 298***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_298_a)

[1] If the parents are not married to each other and if the father recognises the child, or the parent-child relationship is established by court judgment but joint parental responsibility was not ordered at the time of the judgment, joint parental responsibility is established based on a joint declaration by the parents.

[2] In the declaration, the parents confirm that they:


|    1. are prepared to accept joint responsibility for the child; and  
|    2. have agreed on residence and contact or on the sharing of parenting duties and on the child maintenance contribution for the child.

[3] Before making the declaration, the parents may seek advice from the child protection authority.

[4] If the parents make the declaration at the same time as recognising paternity, the declaration is made to the civil registrar. A subsequent declaration must be made to the child protection authority at the child's domicile.

[5] Unless and until the declaration has been made, the mother has sole parental responsibility.

###### [II. Decision of the child protection authority](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_2/tit_8/chap_3/lvl_A_quater/lvl_I_I)

[**Art. 298***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_298_b)

[1] If a parent refuses to make a declaration on joint parental responsibility, the other parent may request the child protection authority at the child's domicile to intervene.

[2] The child protection authority shall order joint parental responsibility, unless the mother should retain sole parental responsibility or sole parental responsibility should be assigned to the father in order to safeguard the child's best interests.

[3] At the same time as deciding on parental responsibility, the child protection authority shall regulate any other matters in dispute. An action for payment of the maintenance contribution may be brought before the competent court; in such a case the court also decides on parental responsibility and other matters relating to the child.

[3bis] In its decision on residence, contact and the sharing of parenting duties, the child protection authority shall take account of the right of the child to maintain regular personal relationships with both parents.

[3ter] Where joint parental responsibility is awarded, with respect to the child’s best interests, it shall consider the possibility of the child residing with both parents on an alternating basis, if this is requested by one of the parents or by the child.

[4] If the mother is a minor or subject to a general deputyship, the child protection authority shall assign parental responsibility to the father or appoint a legal guardian for the child, depending on which measure is more suitable to safeguard the child's best interests.

###### [III. Paternity action](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_2/tit_8/chap_3/lvl_A_quater/lvl_II_I)

[**Art. 298***d*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_298_d)

[1] At the request of either parent, the child or *ex officio*, the child protection authority shall reassign parental responsibility if this is necessary to safeguard the child's best interests due to a substantial change in circumstances.

[2] It may limit itself to regulating residence, contact or the sharing of parenting duties.

[2] At the request of the parents or the child, the child protection authority must do likewise if relations between them have deteriorated to the extent that it is no longer conscionable for the child to remain in the family home and provided no other practical remedy is available in the circumstances.

[3] Where a child has lived for some length of time with foster parents, the child protection authority may forbid the parents to take the child back if such action might pose a serious risk to the child’s development.

[1] Where the testator has exceeded his or her testamentary freedom to the detriment of an heir and the latter fails to bring a action in abatement despite being instructed to do so by the bankruptcy administrators or by creditors holding unpaid debt certificates on succession, the administrators or creditors themselves may bring an action in abatement for the amount necessary to cover their claims within the same time limit that applies to the heir.

[2] The same right applies in the case of a disinheritance not contested by the person disinherited.

[1] Abatement is applied in equal proportion in respect of all named heirs and legatees unless it is evident from the disposition that the testator intended otherwise.

###### [2. On specific legacies](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_3/part_1/tit_14/chap_6/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_2)

Where a specific legacy that cannot be divided without loss of value is to be abated, the legatee may either claim it and pay the balance or claim the disposable amount in lieu of the object.

###### [3. On dispositions inter vivos](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_3/part_1/tit_14/chap_6/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_3)

[2] If the declaration of the invalidity of a later disposition revives an earlier one, the prescriptive periods begin on the date on which invalidity was declared.

[3] The entitlement to abatement may be invoked as a defence at any time.

[1] If the testator during his or her lifetime conferred benefits on a renouncing heir that exceed that heir’s share of the estate, his or her co-heirs may request abatement.

[2] However, such benefits are subject to abatement only to the extent they exceed the statutory entitlement of the renouncing heir.

[3] Allowance is made for them according to the provisions governing hotchpot.

###### [II. Reimbursement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_3/part_1/tit_14/chap_7/lvl_B/lvl_I_I)

[1] If it is impossible to determine whether an heir is alive or dead when succession commences because he or she has disappeared, his or her share of the inheritance is placed under official administration.

[2] Those who would succeed to the missing heir’s share if he or she were dead may request the court to declare the heir presumed dead one year after his or her disappearance in life-threatening circumstances or five years after the last sign of life and, once such declaration has been made, may apply for release of their shares of his or her inheritance.

[3] Such shares are released according to the provisions governing release to the heirs of persons presumed dead.

[1] Where the missing person’s property or succession rights have been under official administration for ten years or more, or he or she would have reached the age of 100, at the request of the competent authority the declaration of presumed death is pronounced *ex officio*.

[2] If no rightful heirs come forward during the public notice period, the property of the person presumed dead passes to the state authority with right to succeed or, if he or she was never resident in Switzerland, to the canton of origin.

[3] The local authority or canton concerned has the same duty of restitution as those put in possession of the estate towards the person presumed dead and parties with prevailing claims.

[1] The legatees have a personal claim against the obligors of their legacies or, where no-one is specifically named as such, against the legal or named heirs.

[2] Unless otherwise provided by testamentary disposition, the claim becomes due once the obligor has accepted the inheritance or is no longer able to disclaim it.

[3] If the heirs fail to fulfil their obligation, they may be sued for release of the bequeathed property or, where the legacy pertains to performance of some action, for damages.

###### [2. Object](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_3/part_2/tit_16/chap_2/lvl_A/lvl_II_I/lvl_2)

[3] Any surplus serves first to satisfy the challenging creditors and any balance remaining after redemption of the other debts passes to the heirs in whose favour the disclaimer was made.

###### [VIII. Liability in the event of disclaimer](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_3/part_2/tit_16/chap_2/lvl_B/lvl_VII_I)

[2] Alterations which permanently hinder or render unprofitable a co-owner’s use or exploitation of the object for its existing purpose may not be carried out without the consent of that co-owner.

[3] Where an alteration would require a co-owner to bear unreasonable costs, in particular because they are disproportionate to the value of his or her share, the alteration may be carried out without his or her consent only if the other co-owners assume such part of his or her share of the costs as exceeds that which he or she may reasonably be expected to meet.

[2] Where the community comprises only two co-owners, each has the right to sue the other; in other cases, unless otherwise agreed, legal action against one co-owner must be authorised by a majority of all the co-owners excluding the person to be sued.

[3] If the court rules in favour of excluding the defendant, it shall order him or her to alienate his or her share and, should he or she fail to do so within the allowed time limit, shall order it to be sold at public auction in accordance with the provisions governing the forced sale of land to the exclusion of the provisions governing dissolution of co-ownership.

[3] When determining the route of a right of way, the interests of both parties must be taken into consideration.

###### [b. Other rights of way](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_1/tit_19/chap_2/lvl_B/lvl_II_I/lvl_7/lvl_b)

[1] If a parcel of land lacks the water required for domestic and farming requirements and if such water cannot be obtained from anywhere else except at an entirely disproportionate cost and effort, the owner may request that a neighbour able to spare such water without suffering hardship allow him or her a share of the latter’s spring or well to him or her in exchange for full compensation.

[2] When determining which water source is thus affected, the interests of the person required to supply the water are the primary consideration.

[**Art. 712***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_712_a) 

[1] Condominium is a form of co-ownership of immovable property that gives the co-owner the exclusive right to make sole use of specific parts of a building thereon and design the interior of such parts.

[2] Each condominium owner is free to manage, use and design the structure of his or her own parts of the building as he or she wishes but must not obstruct any other condominium owners in the exercise of their own rights or in any way damage the common parts of the building, fittings and installations or impair their functional effectiveness or appearance.

[3] Each condominium owner is obliged to maintain his or her parts of the building in the manner required to preserve the sound condition and good appearance of the building as a whole.

###### [II. Object](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_1/tit_19/chap_3/lvl_A/lvl_I_I)

[**Art. 712***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_712_b) 

[1] The object of the exclusive right may be individual storeys or parts of a storey which must be self-contained with their own access and used either as dwellings or as self-contained units of rooms used for business or other purposes, although separate ancillary rooms are allowed.

[2] The condominium owner may not be granted an exclusive right to the following:


|    1. the land on which the building stands and the building right by virtue of which it is constructed;  
|    2. the parts of the building that are vital to the soundness, structure and stability of the building as a whole or of the units of other condominium owners or that determine the outward form and appearance of the building;  
|    3. the fittings and installations that also serve the other condominium owners in the use of their units.

[3] The deed of constitution or a subsequent agreement among the condominium owners executed in the same form may stipulate that other parts of the building are common property, failing which they are presumed to be the object of a exclusive right.

###### [III. Power of disposal](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_1/tit_19/chap_3/lvl_A/lvl_II_I)

[**Art. 712***c*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_712_c) 

[1] Condominium owners do not by law have first right of refusal in respect of a third party acquiring a share, but such right may be stipulated in the deed of constitution or by subsequent agreement and entered under priority notice in the land register.

[2] Similarly, it may be stipulated that the alienation, encumbrance with usufruct or right of residence or letting of a unit is valid only if the other co-owners do not object by resolution made within 14 days of receiving notice of such transaction.

[3] The objection is ineffective if made without good cause.

##### [B. Creation and extinction](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_1/tit_19/chap_3/lvl_B)

[**Art. 712***d*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_712_d) 

[1] Condominium is constituted by entry in the land register.

[2] Such entry may be requested:


|    1. on the basis of an agreement between the condominium owners to constitute their shares as condominium;  
|    2. on the basis of a declaration by the owner of the property or the holder of a distinct and permanent building right to form shares in co-ownership and to constitute the same as condominium.

[3] In order to be valid, the constitution of condominium must be executed in the form of a public deed or, where provided for in a testamentary disposition or in a contract of division of estate, in the form prescribed by the law of succession.

###### [II. Layout of the condominium units and shares in the property](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_1/tit_19/chap_3/lvl_B/lvl_I_I)

[**Art. 712***e*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_712_e) 

[1] The deed of constitution must specify the manner in which the property is divided into condominium units and define the share that each unit represents of the value of the property or of the building right expressed as fractions with a common denominator.

[2] Alteration of the size of a share requires the consent of all directly involved parties and the approval of the assembly of condominium owners; however, each condominium owner is entitled to seek rectification if his or her share has been defined incorrectly in error or is no longer accurate owing to structural modifications to the building or its surroundings.

###### [III. Extinction](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_1/tit_19/chap_3/lvl_B/lvl_II_I)

[**Art. 712***f*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_712_f) 

[1] Condominium is extinguished on the loss of the property or the building right and its deletion from the land register.

[2] Such deletion may be requested in accordance with a termination agreement or by a single condominium owner holding all the shares, but it requires the consent of all persons with rights in rem to the individual units which cannot be transferred to the property as a whole without detriment.

[3] Any condominium owner may request termination of the condominium where:


|    1. more than half the value of the building has been destroyed and reconstruction would impose an onerous burden on him; or  
|    2. the building has been divided into condominium units for more than 50 years and can no longer be used in accordance with the regulations due to its poor structural condition.

4 Condominium owners wishing to maintain the condominium may prevent such termination by buying out the others.

[2] The creditor may request that the land registrar provide him or her with an extract concerning the mortgage contract. Such an extract has only evidential status and does not constitute a negotiable instrument.

[4] If the property is indisputably administrative assets and if the owner's liability for the debt is not based on contractual obligations, the owner shall be liable to the tradesmen or building contractor for debts that are acknowledged or determined by a court in accordance with the provisions on a debt subject to a simple surety, provided a written claim for the debt making reference to the statutory surety was made against the owner no later than four months after completion of the work.

[5] If there is a dispute as to whether immovable property constitutes administrative assets, the tradesman or building contractor may apply for the provisional recording of the lien in the land register no later than four months after completion of the work.
